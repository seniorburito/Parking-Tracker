## Why I am making this? 

Parking near my house is annoying. There are only a few spots by the entrance and if I cant park near the entrance I have to park on the street, which is a much longer walk. It gets really annoying to do that every day, so I drive by the main entrance first to check that there are no parking spots there. However, that also gets annoying because that means more driving. So I am making this so I can check if there are spots near the entrance without driving there. 

## Plan so far: 

* Set up a raspberry Pi with a camera in front of the entrance
* Send parking data from pi to a server via a POST request 
* Get that data on my phone via an app or website through an API to the server
